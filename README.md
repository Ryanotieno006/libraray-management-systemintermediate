## üì¶ Sample Queries

- Find books by Tolkien that are available:
  ```sql
  SELECT title FROM books WHERE author LIKE '%Tolkien%' AND available = TRUE;
List all overdue books:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT b.title, br.name, br.email, l.due_date
FROM loans l
JOIN books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN borrowers br ON l.borrower_id = br.borrower_id
WHERE l.returned = FALSE AND l.due_date < CURDATE();
Top 3 most borrowed authors:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT b.author, COUNT(*) AS loans_count
FROM loans l
JOIN books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY b.author
ORDER BY loans_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
üîÑ Return Process (Atomic Transaction)
Ensures both the loan is marked returned and the book is made available:

sql
Copy
Edit
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE loans SET returned = TRUE WHERE loan_id = 5;
UPDATE books SET available = TRUE WHERE book_id = (
  SELECT book_id FROM loans WHERE loan_id = 5
);
COMMIT;
‚ö° Performance
Indexes added to optimize query speed:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_dates ON loans(checkout_date, due_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_books_author ON books(author);
